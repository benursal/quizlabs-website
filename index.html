					</p>
					<ul class="imaged-list">
						<li>You generate 100 leads a month.</li>
						<li>You generate 100 leads a week.</li>
						<li>You generate over 1,000 leads a month.</li>
						<li>You generate instant sales from these leads using the Silent Selling System with offers on the results page.</li>
						<li>You leverage the Silent Selling Cliff Hanger email sequence to boost sales within 60 days of lead opt-in.</li>
					</ul>
					<br />  
					
					<p>
						That's right success to us means. You generating leads. You generating sales. 
						<br />  
						<br />  
						Anything else means we have failed to deliver on our mission.

					<p class="text-center text-20 text-blue">

					<h4 class="text-center text-light text-20">Engagement and Attention is the new generation of business metrics</h4>
					
					<hr class="aligncenter mb">
					<p>
						Businesses are fighting for attention. If you have attention you are fighting to engage your customers. 
						<br />
						<br />

						In today's market we are bombarded with hundreds of messages per day, all screaming for our immediate attention. 
						<br />
						<br />

						All fighting for our mindshare. 
						<br />
						<br />

						We now live in a society where attention and engagement are the scariest commodities to a marketer or company.
						<br />
						<br />

						If you don't have engagement within seconds your leads will scroll past you.   
						<br />
						<br />

						You think you have to yell louder. And Louder. Until you and 1000's of other businesses are screaming at their customers. 
						<br />
						<br />
						  
						Yelling to get their attention.

						Engagement requires you to understand the needs, desires and problems your customers are experiencing at a deep level. Deeper than traditional marketing activities.

						Yes, the Silent Selling&#0153; System requires you to apply a bit more effort to your marketing campaigns than you usually would.

						<ol class="cute-list">

							<li><b>Identify missed or lost sales opportunities</b> to capitalize on.</li>

								Didn’t even know that Quiz and Survey funnels existed? 
								<br />
								<br />
								  
								Well that’s because you may have been so engaged in the experience that you didn’t realize that you were being sold.
								<br />
								<br />

								Have you ever sat in front of the Television and had hours disappear?   
								<br />
								<br />
								  
								Or have you opened Facebook or Twitter only to realize you lost 30 minutes?   
								<br />
								<br />
								  
								That’s what engagement is.   
								<br />
								<br />
								  
								There is a science behind engagement. It’s called gamification and that is applying the science of games and play to activities  that are not a game. 
								<br />
								<br />								
								  
								Stay with me for a second and let me explain the metrics. *The numbers don’t lie.*  
								<br />
								<br />

								Some companies have realized that Quiz based marketing captivates the attention of your customers. 
								<br />
								<br />
								  
								But it does more than that. 
								<br />
								<br />

								It allows you to ask your leads a series of questions to better qualify them. 
								<br />
								<br />

								This micro-segmentation allows you to personalize your message to your leads in far more detail.   
								<br />
								<br />
								  
								Your leads think you understand their needs better than anyone else. Making you the instant trusted authority. 
								<br />
								<br />
								  
								All because you engaged them and captivated their attention.

						American Professor of Psychology, Robert Cialdini spent years researching the effects of micro-commitments on human behavior. 
						<br />
						<br />
  
						The result being that humans have an inherent nature to honor micro-commitment actions. Think of this as the “Want fries with that” close. Using micro actions to advance means it’s easy to say yes.
						<br />
						<br />
						  
						These actions have been used against us to make billions of dollars in games like World of Warcraft, Pokemon, Grand Theft Auto, Fall Out, Angry Birds have Billions of people spending hours per day and thousands of dollars. Without saying a word. 
						<br />
						<br />

						What’s more is that these people are so engaged they willingly spend hours and thousands of dollars in the pursuit of happiness and instant gratification. 
						<br />
						<br />
						  
						You too can apply these principles to your business and marketing campaigns. 
						<br />

						All they do is engage them.

						Then present the right offer at the right time.

					<p class="text-center text-20">
						The true hidden power behind the Silent Selling&#0153 System <br />is in the <span class="text-italic">Buying Desires Survey.</span> 
					</p>
					<hr class="aligncenter mb">
					<p>
						<img class="img-responsive image-align-right" src="assets/img/gold.png" align="right" />

						This survey method allows you to gain deep insight into your customers to <strong>identity hidden pockets of gold</strong>.   
						<br />
						<br />
						  
						These pockets of gold are the customer segments you didn’t know you had available. Aka new opportunities. Aka the places you are leaving money on the table. 
						<br />
						<br />

						You will also identify the problems your customers want to pay you to solve.
						<br />
						<br />
						  
						That’s right. Imagine the value you would get from knowing exactly the problem you customer are experiencing.   
						<br />
						<br />
						  
						But more importantly exactly what they want to pay you to solve.
						<br />
						<br />
						  
						That’s what we call the Buying Desire Survey. Because for the first time you will truly understand the buying desires of your customer. You will know and understand the mindset to create converting sales copy. 
						<br />
						<br />

						Imagine if you knew exactly the sales copy to write that would resonate with your customers.   
						<br />
						<br />
						  
						That’s what you will know in great detail whenever you complete a Buying Desire Survey. That’s why we call it the hidden power behind the Silent Selling&#0153 System.

						To make your life even easier we have included several Buying Desire Survey Templates inside the QuizLabs template area.
